<p>Claude Levi-Strauss stated that “art is the only proof that anything
has ever happened in the past.” To me, this is one of the most
provocative and truest comments on the role of art that I have ever
read or heard. Everything else is hearsay. I believe in the power of
art and have devoted my career to its production, often focusing on
the history or accomplishments of others.

<p>Throughout the years, my sculptural practice has concentrated on the
transformative properties of fiber and metal in monumental-scale
sculptural forms. The lives of others have always fascinated me; I
think we’re born historical. This inherent curiosity, coupled with my
exposure to world cultures, has influenced my work. Over the years, I
have dedicated works to Marian Anderson, Anne d’Harnoncourt and most
significantly, Malcolm X, completing a series of twenty steles to the
civil rights leader. In the 1990s, I completed a series of Monument
Drawings, twenty-five works on paper to the lives of known and unknown
figures that included Émile Zola, Alexander Pushkin, Man Ray, and
Francesco di Giorgio. I am driven by the power of history and my
monuments connect the temporal, visual and psychological threads of
our shared experience. In essence, I believe memory is everything and
it is my hope that I, in some way, can memorialize the lives of people
whose values transcend time and place.
