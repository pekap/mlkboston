<p>Hank Willis Thomas and MASS Design Group share deep experience with
promoting Social Justice through art and architecture. The built
environment is not neutral. It either heals or it hurts. Art and
Architecture are mechanisms that project values far beyond a physical
being into the lives of communities and people.

<p>HANK WILLIS THOMAS is a conceptual artist working around themes
related to identity, history and popular culture, often seeking out
and utilizing recognizable icons from popular branding and marketing
campaigns. In using icons and other nods to popular culture, he
encourages the viewer to question commercial consumer representation
and the racial stereotypes it perpetuates. A common practice in his
artistic process, Thomas looks to the ways popular imagery informs how
people perceive themselves and others around the world, comparing this
practice to the one of a “visual cultural
archaeologist.”

<p>MASS DESIGN GROUP designs built environments that seek to improve
people’s lives in measurable ways and are infused by the potential to
promote justice and human dignity. MASS rethinks the building not as a
noun but as a verb, and through such transformation, forces the
building process to engage with end stakeholders, and become a
catalyze for hope and change in physical space. The MASS portfolio of
work includes architectural design, master planning, landscape
architecture, engineering, and research. MASS is based in Boston, MA
and Kigali, Rwanda.
