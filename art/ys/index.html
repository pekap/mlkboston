<p>At the centre of my practice is the interrogation of historical and
present day forms of prejudice and discrimination. This is done
through a rigorous exploration of formal and theoretical conversations
around colonialism and its resulting effects on a younger
generation. After encountering the activism in the works of W.E.B Du
Bois, Dr Martin Luther King Jr, artists of the Harlem Renaissance,
Frantz Fanon, Edward Said and many more, I developed a more critically
engaged art practice.  

<p>In the context of the civil rights struggles and continuing
prejudice in the 90’s I evolved a metaphor that has over several years
become my method of challenging binary stereotypes of simplistic ideas
of black and white that often lead to misplaced prejudice. My work
primarily engages with the historical and present day relationship
between Africa and Europe and the global manifestation of those
relations.

<p>I trace the trajectory of a textile that has come to represent
African identity. The bigger implications of how the colonial
relationships between colonial Holland, Indonesia and Africa have
created the batik textiles, that have now become ubiquitous signs of
African identity in the diaspora.  

<p>Context in the past few years have become a poignant political tool in
my practice, since I installed my public sculpture ‘Nelson’s Ship in a
Bottle’ in London’s Trafalgar Square I have continued to explore the
accessible and political potential of a dialogue through art with
millions of people.
