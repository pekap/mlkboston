<p>The Art Committee is co-chaired by Barry Gaither (National Center
for Afro-American Art, and the MFA) and Karin Goodfellow (Director of
the Boston Art Commission).  Other Art Committee members are:
  
<ul>
<li>Brandon Terry, MLK Scholar, Professor, Harvard University    
<li>Cher Krause Knight, Public Art Scholar, Professor of Art History, Emerson 
<li>Danielle Legros Georges, City of Boston Poet Laureate
<li>Ekua Holmes, Boston Art Commission, and the Massachusetts College of Art
and Design
<li>L'Merchie Frazier, Director of Education, Museum of African American History  
</ul>

<p>The goal of the MLK Boston memorial is to inspire visitors by
Dr. King's words, and to also reflect on Boston's history with race
and civil rights, and what work is left to do. What would MLK be
working on if he were alive today?

<p>The MLK Boston Art Committee will publish a simple Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) in November 2017 to solicit applications from
artists from Boston and beyond. We will give artists until January 30,
2018 to send in their applications.

<p>The Art Committee will then evaluate all applications (probably
over a period of months) and then select five finalists, who will then
each be paid to develop renderings for each of their proposals.

<p>We will then go through a public review period of the five
submissions, and the Art Committee will select the artist to be
commissioned for this work.
