<p>The goal of the Boston memorial is to inspire visitors by
Dr. King's words, and to also reflect on Boston's history with race
and civil rights, and what work is left to do. What would MLK be
working on if he were alive today?

<p>The MLK Boston Art Committee  will publish a Requests for
Qualifications (RFQ) in October 2017 to solicit applications
from artists from Boston and beyond.

<p>The Art Committee will then select five finalists, who will then
each be paid to develop renderings for each of their proposals. We
expect to announce these finalists on MLK Day 2018.

<p>We will then go through a public review period of the five
submissions, and the Art Committee will select the artist to be
commissioned for this work.

<p>Questions or suggestions for the Art Committee?
