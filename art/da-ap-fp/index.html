<p>Our team, composed of architect David Adjaye, artist Adam
Pendleton, and curators Future\Pace, brings together innovative
artistic vision with a commitment to social transformation, proven
project management experience, and responsive community involvement.

<p>As Lead Designer for the National Museum of African American
History and Culture in Washington D.C., David Adjaye created an
innovative building that seeks to stimulate reflection, encourage open
dialogue about race, and promote reconciliation and healing.  Adjaye
explains: “I believe in architecture as a social force that actually
makes good. It’s an emancipatory form.”

<p>Adam Pendleton juxtaposes thought-provoking images and language
from the past and present, critically examining their resonance from
varied aesthetic and theoretical perspectives. He integrates writings
by Malcolm X, John Ashbery, Gertrude Stein, and others, combining a
critical use of language, conceptual art, and activism. Pendleton also
incorporates the language of civil rights and social justice movements
throughout his work, including the phrase “Black Lives Matter” in his
installation at the 2015 Venice Biennale.

<p>Future\Pace collaborates with groundbreaking artists to enrich the
urban environment. They facilitate the creation of public art that is
responsive to the environment, history, and society, encouraging
community involvement and interchange. Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. is
serving as an advisor to the project. Our multidisciplinary team
shares a commitment to fill the current void in the representation of
black culture in the public realm. We wish to see a memorial to
Dr. Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King that speaks to their
inspiring vision for equality and justice.
