<p>Wodiczko + Bonder/Maryann Thompson Architects, is an artistic and
design partnership with a combined experience that ranges from
temporary work such as design of participatory projections on monument
and communicative urban equipment to design of residential, cultural
and civic buildings, institutes, museums, memorials and commemorative
public spaces.

<p>Our work is based on a profound commitment to the advancement of
democratic vitality and cultural and pedagogical value of public space
through the creation of new transformative and communicative art,
architecture and design.

<p>As our psycho-political and ethical companions, contemporary
Monuments and Memorials have as historic destiny to preserve the
memory of the past and provide conditions for new responses. As we
renew our commitment to continue the struggle for Human and Civil
Rights for the 21st century, and in the face of the repetition of
historic traumas, human injustices such as present-day mass
incarceration, oppression, continued violence against minorities and
immigrants, we understand the Martin Luther King Memorial in Boston as
a genuine call for action and pro-active engagement for future
generations.

<p>Our concepts and proposals will be carefully studied to
respectfully re-inscribe potential sites into the cognitive map of
Boston, as well as its cultural, political and physical
landscape. Having designed, among many other temporary and permanent
projects, the Memorial to the Abolition of Slavery in Nantes, we, as a
cross-disciplinary team, are able to tackle the issue of how such
sites and how design, art and architecture can contribute to an
expanded and transformative notion of the public domain.
