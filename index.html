<p>The country is divided, but Boston is united. With all that is
going on in our nation today, we need the wisdom of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. more than ever. It is time again to read his speeches and
writings about racial equality, immigrant rights, and many other
social issues.
  
<p>The MLK Boston Committee is working with the City of Boston to
create a world-class
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>
Memorial in Boston. This project was kicked off on September 20, 2017.
(See <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/09/19/boston-mayor-help-tech-executive-build-mlk-memorial-boston/SE3bs0NuYOu4mUs75pbEHP/story.html?et_rid=636692395&s_campaign=todaysheadlines:newsletter">Boston
Globe story</a>.)

<p>The memorial will be designed to inspire visitors with MLK's words,
and will also mention his time in Boston, as well as Boston's own
complex history with race and civil rights.
