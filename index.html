<p><b>Update</b>: our five finalist teams have each submitted their design
proposals. They will be on view at the Boston Public Library in
Copley Square and at the Bolling Building in Roxbury from September
18th through October 16th. <a href="/art/">Please review here</a>.
  
<p>King Boston is a privately funded non-profit working closely with
the City of Boston to create a new memorial and programs about
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King and their time and
work together in Boston. We have held <a href="/events/">fourteen
community meetings</a> to solicit input from our neighbors. King Boston
is now working on the following initiatives:

<ul>

<li>A world-class memorial on the Boston Common, the location
of marches and speeches for hundreds of years in our city.

<li>An interactive MLK Learning Center in Roxbury where we will teach
people to be effective activists to bring change in our city.

<li>A $1M endowment with the Twelfth Baptist Church to do
MLK-related programming, honoring MLK's time preaching at Twelfth
Baptist while he lived in Boston.
  
<li>A new <a href="/film/">documentary</a> about MLK and CSK, focused
on their lives and work together in Boston.

</ul>
