<p>King Boston has selected Boston-based filmmaker
<a href="http://www.robertomighty.com">Roberto Mighty</a> to produce
and direct America’s first documentary, multimedia and online project
about Martin Luther King, Jr and Coretta Scott King’s pivotal years in
Boston in the early 1950’s.

<p>Taking stylistic cues from narrative filmmaking, this documentary
will explore the romantic relationship between Coretta Scott and
Martin Luther King Jr. when they met as college students in Boston;
where they went and what they were doing in the city; and their dreams
for a life of activism and family. From the beginning, they were
committed to making the country a better place. In the end, they made
the world a better place. The project will show that history and make
it relevant to today’s worldwide audiences - utilizing living
witnesses, interactive storytelling, immersive new media installation
and graphic animation.
