<p>"The time is always right to do right." --Martin Luther
King, Jr.

<p>MLK Boston is a new non-profit working closely with the City of
Boston to create a new world-class memorial of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. and Coretta Scott King. We hope that this memorial will inspire
people from Boston and beyond with the Kings' work, and that it will
challenge us to make Boston a better place for all our residents and
visitors. We are running this as an "open source" project with dozens of
opportunities for people to get involved.

<p>Why Now? A King memorial in Boston seems overdue given the issues
that the Kings articulated and sought to achieve within the framework
of the American civil rights movement. Today, the issues we confront
as a nation -- including enduring economic inequalities, labor rights,
racial discrimination and injustice, provocations of white
nationalists, issues of just war and fragile peace, and questions of
immigration and nativism -- make Dr. King’s words and deeds as urgent
and relevant as they were in the past. Coretta Scott King’s words and
activism have also retained their relevance in contemporary
conversations on peace and poverty and underscore the continued
struggle to recognize the voices and work of women in civil rights and
human rights struggles.

<p>The Kings’ example remains indispensable for reflecting upon the
challenges of citizenship, activism, and service that current and
future generations face in pursuit of a just society. At a moment when
public memorials are questioned, it is time to elevate the landscape
of public memory with a monument to this great family of leaders and
share an under acknowledged part of Boston’s story.

<p>Why Boston? Dr. King and Coretta Scott King spent formative and
influential years in Boston, where they met as students. During this
time, King received a PhD from Boston University in systematic
theology, deepening his ideas on religion and politics, while serving
as assistant pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. A life-long
musician, Coretta Scott received a degree in music education in voice
and violin from the New England Conservatory of Music, later
incorporating song and poetry into her important civil rights
work. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the New England
Conservatory of Music in 1971 in recognition of her
accomplishments. Dr. King maintained a significant relationship with
the City of Boston, receiving critical support from local religious
and political leaders like James Reeb, the Unitarian Universalist
minister who was murdered during the voting rights demonstrations in
Selma; depositing archival material for future research at Boston
University; and in 1965 testifying before the Massachusetts
Legislature and holding a march from the South End to the Boston
Common’s Parkman Bandstand where he spoke on civil rights. Boston
proves to be an essential part of the story in the lives of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King. (See
