<p>MLK Boston is in a research phase â€“ talking to stakeholders,
discussing <a href="/donate/">fundraising strategy</a>, working with
the City to think about the <a href="/art/">artist RFQ process</a>,
and most importantly <a href="/resources/">researching</a> the life
and work of Martin Luther King, Jr.

<p>Realizing what MLK means to many Bostonians, we are committed to a
transparent and robust public process. This will include regular
community meetings around the city.  We expect to soon publish a
project timeline, and in the meantime, would love
to <a href="/contact/">hear from you</a>.  We are humbled by the
outpouring of support, and we are excited to do the work to create a
fitting tribute to an historical giant.

<p>Here are our current priorities:
  
<ol>

<li>Setup a MLK Boston fund at The Boston Foundation, seeded with $1M
to start, towards our $5M goal needed for this project. (Most of
these funds will be used for the memorial, but some part of the
funds will be used for educational programs.)</li>

<li>Hire an <a href="/team/director.html">Executive Director</a>.</li>

<li>Publish our Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in November 2017 as a
call to artists from Boston and beyond, giving them a simple way to
submit their portfolio for consideration. <a href="/art/">More
info</a>.</li>

<li>Run community meetings every few weeks to get input from diverse
groups around Boston.</li>

</ol>
