<p>"The time is always right to do right." --Martin Luther
King, Jr.

<p>There is a new movement in Boston to bring the legacy of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King back into discussions of what
we want for our society today. Fifty years after his work, his words
ring true more than ever.

<p>MLK Boston is a new non-profit working closely with the City of
Boston to bring a world-class permanent installation commemorating
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s and Coretta Scott King’s legacy to
Boston, and to sponsor local events and discussions to bring their
words to life. With all that is going on in our nation today, we need
the wisdom of the Kings right now. It is time again to revisit the
work of Coretta Scott King and read Dr. King’s speeches and writings
about racial equality, immigrant rights, war, economic fairness, and
many other issues about social justice.

<p>The new memorial will be designed to inspire visitors with the
Kings’ words, and will challenge visitors to think about what they
would be speaking about today, and what are the responsibilities of
each of us to continue their work. This will be an "open source"
project with dozens of opportunities for people to get involved.

<p>Why Now? A King memorial in Boston seems overdue given the issues
and social justice Dr. King articulated and sought to achieve within
the framework of the American civil rights movement. Today, the issues
we confront as a nation -- including enduring economic inequalities,
labor rights, racial discrimination and injustice, provocations of
white nationalists, issues of just war and fragile peace, and
questions of immigration and nativism -- make Dr. King’s words and
deeds as urgent and relevant as they were in the past. Coretta Scott
King’s words and activism have also retained their relevance in
contemporary conversations on peace and poverty and underscore the
continued struggle to recognize the voices and work of women in civil
rights and human rights struggles.

<p>The Kings’ example remains indispensable for reflecting upon the
challenges of citizenship, activism, and service that current and
future generations face in pursuit of a just society. At a moment when
public memorials are questioned, it is time to elevate the landscape
of public memory with a monument to this great family of leaders and
share an under acknowledged part of Boston’s story.

<p>Why Boston? Dr. King and Coretta Scott King spent formative and
influential years in Boston, where they met as students. During this
time, King received a PhD from Boston University in systematic
theology, deepening his ideas on religion and politics, while serving
as assistant pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. A life-long
musician, Coretta Scott received a degree in music education in voice
and violin from the New England Conservatory of Music, later
incorporating song and poetry into her important civil rights
work. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from the New England
Conservatory of Music in 1971 in recognition of her
accomplishments. Dr. King maintained a significant relationship with
the City of Boston, receiving critical support from local religious
and political leaders like James Reeb, the Unitarian Universalist
minister who was murdered during the voting rights demonstrations in
Selma; depositing archival material for future research at Boston
University; and in 1965 testifying before the Massachusetts
Legislature and holding a march from the South End to the Boston
Common’s Parkman Bandstand where he spoke on civil rights. Boston
proves to be an essential part of the story in the lives of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King. (See
