<p>"The time is always right to do right." --Martin Luther
King, Jr.
  
<p>There is a new movement in Boston to bring the legacy of Martin
Luther King, Jr. and Coretta Scott King back into discussions of what
we want for our society today. Fifty years after his work, his words
ring true more than ever.

<p>MLK Boston is a new non-profit working closely with the City of
Boston to bring a world-class MLK Memorial to Boston, and to sponsor
local events and discussions to bring his words to life.  With all
that is going on in our nation today, we need the wisdom of Dr. King
right now. It is time again to read his speeches and writings about
racial equality, immigrant rights, war, economic fairness, and many
other issues about social justice.
  
<p>The new memorial will be designed to inspire visitors with
Dr. King's words, and will challenge visitors to think about what MLK
would be speaking about today, and what are the responsibilities of
each of us to continue his work. This will be an "open source" 
project with dozens of opportunities for people to get
involved.

<p><b>Why Boston?</b> - Dr. King had very formative and influential
years in Boston, including getting his Ph.D. from Boston University,
meeting Coretta Scott in Boston, preaching at the 12th Baptist Church,
holding a march to the Boston Common where he gave a speech about
civil rights, and also testifying before the Massachusetts
Legislature. Dr. King also arranged to have his papers kept at
Boston University. Want to learn more? See these articles:
