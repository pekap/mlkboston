<p>We are running MLK Boston as an open process, with lots of
<a href="/events/">public events</a> and a
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/mlkboston">Facebook
group</a> where you can make your voice be heard.

<p>As part of getting the word out, we frequently update members of
the media so they can help inform the general public about our plans.
Here is some of the coverage we have received to date:
