<p>"The time is always right to do right." --Martin Luther
King, Jr.

<p>MLK Boston is a new non-profit working closely with the City of
Boston to create a new world-class memorial of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. and Coretta Scott King. We hope that this memorial will inspire
people from Boston and beyond with the Kings' work, and that it will
challenge us to make Boston a better place for all our residents and
visitors. We are running this as an "open source" project with dozens of
opportunities for people to get involved.

<p>Why Now? A King memorial in Boston seems overdue given the issues
that the Kings articulated and sought to achieve within the framework
of the American civil rights movement. Today, the issues we confront
as a nation -- including enduring economic inequalities, labor rights,
racial discrimination and injustice, provocations of white
nationalists, issues of just war and fragile peace, and questions of
immigration and nativism -- make Dr. King’s words and deeds as urgent
and relevant as they were in the past. Coretta Scott King’s words and
activism have also retained their relevance in contemporary
conversations on peace and poverty and underscore the continued
struggle to recognize the voices and work of women in civil rights and
human rights struggles.

<p>The Kings’ example remains indispensable for reflecting upon the
challenges of citizenship, activism, and service that current and
future generations face in pursuit of a just society. At a moment when
public memorials are questioned, it is time to elevate the landscape
of public memory with a monument to this great family of leaders and
share an under acknowledged part of Boston’s story.
