<p>The Boston Foundation (<a href="http://www.tbf.org">web</a>) has
setup an "MLK Boston Fund" which will be used to raise money for the
memorial. The fund started with a $1M donation from
<a href="http://pme.org">Paul English</a>, and we're looking to
raise an additional $4M for the project.

<p>We are seek additional funding from other philanthropists, Boston
companies and nonprofits, schools and churches, and the general
public. We want the donor base to be as wide as possible, so that this
becomes a monument for all people.

<p>Please be one of our first donors and help us test our new
<a href="https://www.tbf.org/donors/forms/mlk-boston">MLK Boston
Donation Form</a> and then <a href="/contact/">send feedback</a>
about the donation process.

<p>If you are interested in helping us fundraise,
please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a>.
