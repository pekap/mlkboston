<p>One of the most important decisions we have to collectively make is
where the MLK Boston memorial will be located. Understanding that
Bostonians will have many different opinions, and recognizing that we
must go through a process to come to consensus, we wanted to start the
conversation here. So far, talk has focused broadly on two
neighborhoods: Downtown on the Boston Common, and Roxbury. Should it
be in Roxbury, maybe near the Twelfth Baptist Church, where Dr. King
was a member during his time in Boston? Or should it be Downtown,
maybe on the Boston Common, near where he spoke from the Parkman
Bandstand? Or is there another location entirely that makes the most
sense? We hope to engage with the entire Boston community as we work
through this important question.

<h3>The Case for Roxbury</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>History</b>: Dr. King was the assistant pastor of the Twelfth
Baptist Church in Roxbury during the 1950s.</p>

<li><b>Historically African-American Neighborhood</b>: While Dr. King
spoke to all people about social justice issues, his biggest base and
focus were on African-American people, and thus we should locate the
memorial in a historically African American neighborhood.</p>

<li><b>Local business</b>: If we locate the memorial in Roxbury, it
could theoretically bring additional traffic to the area, impacting
local business and spurring economic activity.</p>
  
<li><b>Tourism</b>: Boston’s third or fourth largest industry is
tourism, and a substantial tourist site like a MLK memorial could also
lift up other sites like the National Center for Afro-American
artists, the Shirley Eustis House and others.</p>

</ul>

<h3>The Case for the Boston Common</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>History</b>: In 1965, Dr. King led a march from the South End
to the Boston Common, where he gave a speech at the Parkman
Bandstand. He also testified before the Massachusetts legislature at
the State House.</p>

<li><b>Number of visitors</b>: The Boston Common already attracts
millions of visitors a year, and is easily accessible on the Red,
Green and Orange MBTA lines.</p>
  
<li><b>Tourism</b>: Boston’s third or fourth largest industry is
tourism, and a substantial tourist site like a MLK memorial would lift
up other sites of significance in Boston’s African-American history
like the Museum of African American History on Beacon Hill, the Robert
Gould Shaw and the 54th Regiment Memorial, the Boston Massacre
Monument which honors Crispus Attucks among its martyrs, both already
on Boston Common, and the Boston Women’s Memorial on Commonwealth
Mall, where Phillis Wheatley is honored.</p>

<li><b>Maintenance</b>: The Boston Common is a City of Boston Park,
and therefore already has maintenance services that could be leveraged
to take care of the memorial.</p>
  
<li><b>Funds</b>: The city already has a budget for improvements to
the Boston Common, from the sale of the Winthrop Square garage, which
could be leveraged for any infrastructure needed for the memorial.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Other Locations</h3>

<p>Or, is there a site in the city that we have not discussed that
would be the right place? We’d love to hear your thoughts.
