<p>One of the most important decisions we have to collectively make is
where the MLK Boston memorial will be located. Understanding that
Bostonians will have many different opinions, and recognizing that we
must go through a process to come to consensus, we wanted to start the
conversation here. So far, talk has focused broadly on two
neighborhoods: Downtown on the Boston Common, and Roxbury. Should it
be in Roxbury, maybe near the Twelfth Baptist Church, where Dr. King
was a member during his time in Boston? Or should it be Downtown,
maybe on the Boston Common, near where he spoke from the Parkman
Bandstand? Or is there another location entirely that makes the most
sense? The South End, where the Kings lived while they were in Boston?
Near Boston University, where Dr. King went to school?
