<p>One of the most important decisions we have to collectively make is
where the MLK Boston memorial will be located. Understanding that
Bostonians will have many different opinions, and recognizing that we
must go through a public process to come to a decision, we wanted to
start the conversation here. So far, talk has focused broadly on the
following neighborhoods:

<ul>
<li>Roxbury, maybe near the Twelfth Baptist Church
<li>South End, where the Kings lived while they were in Boston
<li>Boston Common, where Dr. King led a march and spoke
<li>Boston University, where MLK earned his PhD
</ul>

<p>Should the memorial be built at one of the above locations, or is
there another location entirely that makes the most sense?
